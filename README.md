## 1. Introductiuon 

This project aims to segment customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior using the K-Means clustering algorithm. Customer segmentation helps businesses tailor their marketing strategies to different customer groups, improving customer satisfaction and business performance.

## 2. Project Overview

The project involves the following steps:

- Data collection and preprocessing
- Applying the K-Means clustering algorithm
- Evaluating the clustering results
- Visualizing the clusters

## 3. Data Description

The dataset used in this project contains customer information such as age, gender, annual income, and spending score. Each record represents a unique customer.

## 4. Methodology

  ## 4.1. Data Preprocessing

  Data preprocessing involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, and normalizing the features to ensure the K-Means algorithm performs optimally.

  ## 4.2. K-Means Clustering

  K-Means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that partitions the data into K clusters, where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean.

  ## 4.3. Evaluation Metrics

  The clustering results are evaluated using metrics such as the silhouette score and the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters.

## 5. Results

The results section presents the identified customer segments, their characteristics, and visualizations of the clusters. Key insights and patterns observed in the data are also discussed.

## 6. Conclusion

This section summarizes the findings of the project, highlighting the effectiveness of K-Means clustering in customer segmentation and its potential applications in business strategies.

## 7. Recommendation

Suggestions for future work include exploring other clustering algorithms, incorporating additional features, and applying the model to different datasets.

## 8. Usage

To use the project, run the following command:

python main.py
